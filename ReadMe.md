## IBM Employee Attrition Exploration

This document explores a dataset containing information relating to employee attrition including attrition, monthly income, job satisfaction, performance rating, age, no. of years worked.
Employee attrition is when an employee ceases working for a company for any reason and is not replaced for a long time.

We looked IBM's employees attrition dataset then explored the following questions:

+ What are the factors behind employee attrition?
+ What is the relationship between Education and Monthly Income?
+ What is the effect of age on attrition?
+ Is Income the main factor towards employee attrition?
+ How does work-life balance impact the overall attrition rate?

Here are the findings from the exploration carried out:

1. **What are the factors behind employee attrition?**

     I think these are the three main factors:
+ Monthly Income: On the average employees with lower salary (an average of 4800) are no longer working. This seems like an important factor affecting employee attrition
+ Years worked at the company: It is seen on the average that employees who spend lesser years (5 years and below) at the company are more likely to leave. It can be said that spending a few years at the company can easily move but those who spend a lot of years (7 years and above) at the company makes the employees less likely to leave.
+ Job Level: We can see those in the lower rank (level 1) tend to leave while those from level 2 remain. This could mean just being promoted to the next level encourages employees to stay.

2. **What is the relationship between Education and Monthly Income?**
+ Looking at the relationship between education and monthly income, the average monthly income rises as the education level increases. There is a positive relationship between the two variables.

3. **What is the effect of age on attrition?**
+ There seem to be employee attrition within those of younger ages (average off 33 years and younger). It could mean that young employees have more freedom to move from one company to another.

4. **Is Income the main factor towards employee attrition?**
+  On the average, employees with lower salary ranges tend to stop working at the company. There seems to be a strong relationship and it can be considered an important factor affecting employee attrition. I believe it is the main factor

5. **How does work-life balance impact the overall attrition rate?**
+ There do not seem to be any relationship between attrition and work life balance so we can say work life balance has little or no impact on the overall attrition rate
